# Unifile

A python script to unify your files indents, encoding, line endings according to editorconfig file
and/or specified via CLI rules.


# Prerequisites

Install requirements `python -m pip install src/requirements.txt`

# Usage

Trivial case to process most of files: `python unifile.py <path-to-file or path-to-folder>` which would fix files right in place.

By default script relies on rules specified via '.editorconfig' files and though processes only files, covered by them.

You can enforces to process all files within folder with `-all` option. In that case
if specified path is a folder, then it should contain text files only, including nested folders, or avoid blobs and other files with `--include` and `--exclude` options. If there is files encodings other than `utf-8` - specify all possible encodings via `--encoding` options.

Check help for other cases with `python unifile.py -h`.

Checkout `test/test.sh` for example.
